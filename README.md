# WiFiSecurity

Authenticators, which utilize lengthy security keys to generate numbers, present an intriguing concept that can be adapted to WiFi networks, prompting a system that periodically transfigures the SSID and password keys. Envision this: a security system with the capability to evolve persistently. This system would utilize one-time, time-bound codes for the SSID and a separate one for the password. Moreover, devices could swiftly correlate the real-time SSID to an independent WiFi key, valid for a specific and fixed time constraint. The result would be a formidable shield of dynamically evolving WiFi security. Even though attackers might manage to eavesdrop on traffic after transmission, the constantly shifting nature of this system would hinder their attempts to gain network access. In essence, these evolutions would switch keys faster than they can feasibly be cracked. Further, with the ability to set SSID and Passwords to a unique key each interval.
